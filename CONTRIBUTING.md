## Style Guide

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper `alt` attributes for images
- Maintain proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Use lowercase for element names and attributes

```html
<!-- Good -->
<button id="compareBtn" class="primary-btn" title="Compare files">
  Compare
</button>

<!-- Avoid -->
<BUTTON ID="compareBtn" CLASS="primary-btn">Compare</BUTTON>
```

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow BEM naming convention where appropriate
- Group related properties together
- Use meaningful class names

```css
/* Good */
.file-container {
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  background: var(--background-color);
  transition: var(--transition);
}

/* Avoid */
.fc {
  padding: 24px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background: #fff;
}
```

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features (classes, arrow functions, const/let)
- Follow camelCase naming convention
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Handle errors gracefully

```javascript
// Good
class DiffCheckerPro {
  /**
   * Processes text before comparison
   * @param {string} text - The text to process
   * @returns {string} Processed text
   */
  preprocessText(text) {
    let processed = text;
    
    if (this.ignoreWhitespace.checked) {
      processed = processed.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
    }
    
    return processed;
  }
}

// Avoid
function processText(t) {
  var p = t;
  if (ignoreWS) p = p.replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
  return p;
}
```

### Git Commits

Use conventional commit messages:

```

style: improve button hover animations
refactor: simplify diff rendering logic
test: add browser compatibility tests
```
